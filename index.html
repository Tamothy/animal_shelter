    <h1>Welcome to Tam's and Lucy's Animal Adoption Center!</h1>

    <p>Tam and Lucy went out for an adult beverage on a wasted Wedndesday and found all these precious creatures.  They seemed to all be taking naps, but really they were pining for new homes.  They would love to live with YOU! Please adopt these wonderful animals because if they don't find a place we will sell them in the black market, and that's illegal, but won't stop us.</p>

    <h2>Animals to be adopted:</h2>
